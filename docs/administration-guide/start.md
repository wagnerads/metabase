## Administration Guide

Are you in charge of managing Metabase for your organization? Then you're in the right spot. You are the chosen one.

**This guide will teach you about:**

* [Connecting Metabase to databases in your organization](01-managing-databases.md)
* [Enabling features that send email (SMTP)](02-setting-up-email.md)
* [Editing your database metadata](03-metadata-editing.md)
* [Managing user accounts](04-managing-users.md)
* [Creating segments and metrics](05-segments-and-metrics.md)
* [Configuring settings](06-configuration-settings.md)
* [Setting up Slack integration](07-setting-up-slack.md)
* [Enabling single sign-on with Google](08-single-sign-on.md)

First things first, you'll need to install Metabase. If you haven’t done that yet, our [Installation Guide](../operations-guide/start.md#installing-and-running-metabase) will help you through the process.

Already done with that? Then let’s start with going over [connecting Metabase to your database](01-managing-databases.md).
